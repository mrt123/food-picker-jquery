============

Hi Guys,


Here is a little project I wrote in order to replace my few years old Excel spreadsheet.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, and examples of how this code can be improved. It is paramount to me that Classes are well separated, and code is extensible and as easy to read/intuitive as possible.



Most popular libraries are already part of the project (Angular, Handlebars, JQuery, Less). Running application can be found at: http://mrt123.github.io/meal-planner/
